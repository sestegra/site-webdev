  Angular applications are styled with standard CSS. That means you can apply
  everything you know about CSS stylesheets, selectors, rules, and media queries
  directly to Angular applications.
  
  Additionally, Angular can bundle *component styles*
  with components, enabling a more modular design than regular stylesheets.
  
  This page describes how to load and apply these component styles.

  Run the <live-example></live-example> of the code shown in this page.

  ## Using component styles
  
  For every Angular component you write, you may define not only an HTML template,
  but also the CSS styles that go with that template, 
  specifying any selectors, rules, and media queries that you need.

  One way to do this is to set the `styles` property in the component metadata.
  The `styles` property takes #{_an} #{_array} of strings that contain CSS code.
  Usually you give it one string, as in the following example:
  
+makeExample('component-styles/ts/app/hero-app.component.ts')(format='.')

:marked
  The selectors you put into a component's styles apply only within the template
  of that component. The `h1` selector in the preceding example applies only to the `<h1>` tag
  in the template of `HeroAppComponent`. Any `<h1>` elements elsewhere in
  the application are unaffected.
  
  This is a big improvement in modularity compared to how CSS traditionally works.
  
  * You can use the CSS class names and selectors that make the most sense in the context of each component. 
  * Class names and selectors are local to the component and don't collide with 
    classes and selectors used elsewhere in the application.
  * Changes to styles elsewhere in the application don't affect the component's styles.
  * You can co-locate the CSS code of each component with the Dart and HTML code of the component,
    which leads to a neat and tidy project structure.
  * You can change or remove component CSS code without searching through the
    whole application to find where else the code is used.

  ## Special selectors
  
  Component styles have a few special *selectors* from the world of shadow DOM style scoping
  (described in the [CSS Scoping Module Level 1](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-scoping-1) page on the 
  [W3C](https://www.w3.org) site).
  The following sections describe these selectors.
  
  ### :host

  Use the `:host` pseudo-class selector to target styles in the element that *hosts* the component (as opposed to
  targeting elements *inside* the component's template).
  
+makeExample('component-styles/ts/app/hero-details.component.css', 'host')(format='.')

:marked
  The `:host` selector is the only way to target the host element. You can't reach
  the host element from inside the component with other selectors because it's not part of the
  component's own template. The host element is in a parent component's template.
  
  Use the *function form* to apply host styles conditionally by 
  including another selector inside parentheses after `:host`.
  
  The next example targets the host element again, but only when it also has the `active` CSS class.
  
+makeExample('component-styles/ts/app/hero-details.component.css', 'hostfunction')(format=".")
  
:marked
  ### :host-context
  
  Sometimes it's useful to apply styles based on some condition *outside* of a component's view.
  For example, a CSS theme class could be applied to the document `<body>` element, and
  you want to change how your component looks based on that.
  
  Use the `:host-context()` pseudo-class selector, which works just like the function
  form of `:host()`. The `:host-context()` selector looks for a CSS class in any ancestor of the component host element,
  up to the document root. The `:host-context()` selector is useful when combined with another selector.
  
  The following example applies a `background-color` style to all `<h2>` elements *inside* the component, only
  if some ancestor element has the CSS class `theme-light`.
  
+makeExample('component-styles/ts/app/hero-details.component.css', 'hostcontext')(format='.')
  
:marked
  ### /deep/
  
  Component styles normally apply only to the HTML in the component's own template. 
  
  Use the `/deep/` selector to force a style down through the child component tree into all the child component views.
  The `/deep/` selector works to any depth of nested components, and it applies to both the view
  children and content children of the component. 
  
  The following example targets all `<h3>` elements, from the host element down 
  through this component to all of its child elements in the DOM. 
+makeExample('component-styles/ts/app/hero-details.component.css', 'deep')(format=".")

:marked
  The `/deep/` selector also has the alias `>>>`. You can use either interchangeably.

.alert.is-important
  :marked
    Use the `/deep/` and `>>>` selectors only with *emulated* view encapsulation.
    Emulated is the default and most commonly used view encapsulation. For more information, see the
    [Controlling view encapsulation](#view-encapsulation) section.

  ## Loading styles into components
  
  There are several ways to add styles to a component: 
  * By setting `styles` or `styleUrls` metadata.
  * Inline in the template HTML.
  * With CSS imports.
  
  The scoping rules outlined earlier apply to each of these loading patterns.
 
  ### Styles in metadata
  
  You can add a `styles` #{_array} property to the `@Component` #{_decorator}.
  Each string in the #{_array} (usually just one string) defines the CSS.

+makeExample('component-styles/ts/app/hero-app.component.ts')

:marked
  ### Style URLs in metadata
  
  You can load styles from external CSS files by adding a `styleUrls` attribute
  into a component's `@Component` #{_decorator}:

+makeExample('component-styles/ts/app/hero-details.component.ts', 'styleurls')

:marked
  Note that the URLs in `styleUrls` are relative to the component.

//- TODO: determine if an equivalent of the TS "module bundlers"
//- material is relevant for Dart.

:marked
  ### Template inline styles
  
  You can embed styles directly into the HTML template by putting them
  inside `<style>` tags.
  
+makeExample('component-styles/ts/app/hero-controls.component.ts', 'inlinestyles')

:marked
  ### Template link tags
  
  You can also embed `<link>` tags into the component's HTML template. 
  
  The link tag's `href` URL is relative to the 
  application root, not the component file.

+makeExample('component-styles/ts/app/hero-team.component.ts', 'stylelink')

:marked
  ### CSS @imports
  
  You can also import CSS files into the CSS files using the standard CSS `@import` rule.
  For details, see [`@import`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/@import)
  on the [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org) site.
  
  In *this* case the URL is relative to the CSS file into which we are importing.

.alert.is-important
  :marked
    URLs are currently not interpreted in this way, see 
    [issue #39](https://github.com/dart-lang/angular2/issues/39).
    Until this issue is fixed, absolute package-reference style URLs must 
    be given, as illustrated below.
  
+makeExample('component-styles/ts/app/hero-details.component.css', 'import', 'app/hero-details.component.css (excerpt)')

a#view-encapsulation
.l-main-section

  ## Controlling view encapsulation: native, emulated, and none
  
  As discussed earlier, component CSS styles are encapsulated into the component's view and don't
  affect the rest of the application.
  
  To control how this encapsulation happens on a *per
  component* basis, you can set the *view encapsulation mode* in the component metadata.
  Choose from the following modes:
  
  * `Native` view encapsulation uses the browser's native shadow DOM implementation (see
    [Shadow DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Shadow_DOM) 
    on the [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org) site)
    to attach a shadow DOM to the component's host element, and then puts the component
    view inside that shadow DOM. The component's styles are included within the shadow DOM.
  * `Emulated` view encapsulation (the default) emulates the behavior of shadow DOM by preprocessing
    (and renaming) the CSS code to effectively scope the CSS to the component's view.
    For details, see [Appendix 1](#inspect-generated-css).
  * `None` means that Angular does no view encapsulation. 
    Angular adds the CSS to the global styles. 
    The scoping rules, isolations, and protections discussed earlier don't apply. 
    This is essentially the same as pasting the component's styles into the HTML.
    
  To set the components encapsulation mode, use the `encapsulation` property in the component metadata:
  
+makeExample('component-styles/ts/app/quest-summary.component.ts', 'encapsulation.native')(format='.')

:marked
  `Native` view encapsulation only works on browsers that have native support
  for shadow DOM (see [Shadow DOM v0](http://caniuse.com/#feat=shadowdom) on the 
  [Can I use](http://caniuse.com) site). The support is still limited,
  which is why `Emulated` view encapsulation is the default mode and recommended
  in most cases.

a#inspect-generated-css
.l-main-section
:marked
  ## Appendix 1: Inspecting the CSS generated in emulated view encapsulation
  
  When using emulated view encapsulation, Angular preprocesses
  all component styles so that they approximate the standard shadow CSS scoping rules.
  
  In the DOM of a running Angular application with emulated view
  encapsulation enabled, each DOM element has some extra classes
  attached to it:
  
code-example(format="").
  &lt;hero-details class="_nghost-pmm-5">
    &lt;h2 class="_ngcontent-pmm-5">Mister Fantastic&lt;/h2>
    &lt;hero-team class="_ngcontent-pmm-5 _nghost-pmm-6">
      &lt;h3 class="_ngcontent-pmm-6">Team&lt;/h3>
    &lt;/hero-team>
  &lt;/hero-detail>

:marked
  There are two kinds of generated classes:
  * An element that would be a shadow DOM host in native encapsulation has a
    generated `_nghost` class. This is typically the case for component host elements.
  * An element within a component's view has a `_ngcontent` class 
  that identifies to which host's emulated shadow DOM this element belongs.
  
  The exact values of these classes aren't important. They are automatically
  generated and you never refer to them in application code. But they are targeted
  by the generated component styles, which are in the `<head>` section of the DOM:
  
code-example(format="").
  ._nghost-pmm-5 {
    display: block;
    border: 1px solid black;
  }

  h3._ngcontent-pmm-6 {
    background-color: white;
    border: 1px solid #777;
  }
  
:marked
  These styles are post-processed so that each selector is augmented
  with `_nghost` or `_ngcontent` class selectors. 
  These extra selectors enable the scoping rules described in this page.
  
a#relative-urls
.l-main-section
:marked
  ## Appendix 2: Loading styles with relative URLs
  
  It's common practice to split a component's code, HTML, and CSS into three separate files in the same directory:
  
code-example(format="nocode").
  quest_summary_component.dart
  quest_summary_component.html
  quest_summary_component.css

:marked
  You include the template and CSS files by setting the `templateUrl` and `styleUrls` metadata properties respectively.
  Because these files are co-located with the component,
  it would be nice to refer to them by name without also having to specify a path back to the root of the application.

  Thankfully, this is the default interpretation of relative URLs in AngularDart:
